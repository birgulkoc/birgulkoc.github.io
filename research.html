       <h1>RESEARCH</h1>
       <p>For under-resolved regimes, we know that the standard ROM which is the Galerkin ROM (G-ROM)
        is not totally capable to model the main dynamics of the problem. Thus, to increase the computational
        accuracy of the numerical method, we either use more POD modes to construct the ROM which increases the
        computational cost or add a low-dimensional closure term that models the relationship between the resolved
        and unresolved POD modes and is. All the methods we present in this project are based on the latter approach.
        In other words, we aim to find an accurate and efficient closure term that models sub-scales.</a></p>
